They occur most commonly in mangroves and swamp forests, particularly in riverine habitats; however, they are also commonly found in human-altered habitats, which include temples, roadsides, agricultural areas, and rural/urban settlements (Gumert 2011). It is possible that a significant portion of their population is synanthropic. They have inhabited human environments for millennia. Consequently, anthropogenic ecologies are an important aspect of their historical natural ecology (Gumert et al. 2011, Fuentes et al. 2005, Marty et al. 2020), and should be considered as such when considering their habitat types."
